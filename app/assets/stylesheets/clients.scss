// positioning: absolute vs relative

// absolute is based off the dom..give it two more parameters top 10 px right 10px
// even if this div is nested within parent divs, absolute will remove it and append it to the dom
// removes it from that flow

// normally when you have a n object it is relative to its parents div
// default is relative...relative to its parents
// **everything is relative to the body...the body is just an explicit body tag

// high contrast of text and larger fonts
// everything should be either exactly the same or drastically different

// to target about page has a super div that is 100% of the height and width of the body
//body {
//     background-image: url("paper.gif");
//     background-color: #cccccc;
// }  COVER
